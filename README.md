# light-detection
Used to program an automated solar panel base-structure to automatically adjust to the movements of the sun.
Operates off a main loop consisting of an if-then statement which determines movement using light strength as a condition.
The two peripheral sensors drive the program in an attempt to keep the middle sensor in a position with the most light exposure.
